            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello my name is Jonathan Pohahau, I'm inspiring to be a software engineer. 
                 My ethnicity is Tongan, Indonesian, and Portugese, although I am not fluent in any of those languages I was raised up with those different cultures to which I learned to use as my advantage.
                 I define myself to be hard working, determined, open minded, and a leader by example. 
                 My biggest flaw is that I am prideful due to coming from a house hold where my mother had to be the mom and dad to three children. 
                 I know how pride is a double edge sword but with my experience of having to build myself up from nothing and just always finding a way I use my pride as a skill or tool instead of a obstical that I had to over come.
                 Me and my siblings did not have all the advantages that others had, yet we all still became college graduates with one becoming a doctor, the other having a computer science degree from USF graduating Summa Cum Laude, and then me earning a full ride scholarship for football then graduating during the height of the pandemic.
                 With the way my mother raised us to "never quit anything you started because there is always a way through your problems no matter how difficult the situation is" creeated the foundation we needed to navigate through lifes problems so far.</p>
