            <p>Hello my name is Jonathan Pohahau, I'm inspiring to be a software engineer. 
                 My ethnicity is Tongan, Indonesian, and Portugese. Although I am not fluent in any of those languages, I was raised up with those different cultures, to which I learned to use as my advantage.
                 I define myself to be hard working, determined, open minded, and a leader by example. 
                 My biggest flaw is that I am prideful, due to coming from a household where my mother had to be the mom and dad to three children. 
                 I know how pride is a double-edged sword, but with my experience of having to build myself up from nothing and always finding a way I use my pride as a skill or tool instead of a obstacle that I had to overcome.
                 My siblings and I did not have all the advantages that others had, yet we all became college graduates with one becoming a doctor, the other having a computer science degree from USF, graduating Summa Cum Laude, and then I earned a full-ride scholarship for football and graduating during the height of the pandemic.
                 Our mother raised us with the mindset of "never quit anything you started because there is always a way through your problems no matter how difficult the situation is." This created the foundation we needed to navigate through all of lifes problems we have experienced so far.</p>
